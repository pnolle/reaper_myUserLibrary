#  REAPER user library changes

This repo keeps the changes I made to files in my REAPER user library like updated JS FX or VST settings.

## Contents

* ``Data/ix_keymaps/``: MIDI keymaps for the effect ``MIDI Map To Key v2``.
* ``Effects/ix/``: MIDI effects

The repo reflects the state of these folders in version ``v7.28``. Check with later versions if it still fits.

## How to use

Clone this repo into the ``Users\<usr>\Library\Application Support\REAPER\`` folder.
